# Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors for Machine Learning

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors are among the most misunderstood topics in Linear Algebra. The good news: **for Machine Learning, you do NOT need deep mathematical proofs.** You only need to understand what they represent, why they matter, how PCA uses them, and where they appear in ML.

---

## 1. Why Do We Need Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors?

A matrix represents a **transformation** — it can stretch, compress, rotate, or reflect vectors. Most vectors **change direction** after a transformation. However, some special vectors behave differently — these are called **Eigenvectors**. The amount they're stretched or compressed is called the **Eigenvalue**.

---

## 2. Intuition First — The Rubber Sheet

Imagine a sheet of rubber. You stretch it. Most arrows drawn on it will **rotate and change direction and length**. But some special arrows will **keep the same direction, only changing length**. Those arrows are Eigenvectors. The stretching factor is the Eigenvalue.

---

## 3. What is an Eigenvector?

A vector whose **direction remains unchanged** after a transformation (only its length may change).

```
Before:  ↗
After:   ↗↗↗   (same direction, just longer)
```

## 4. What is an Eigenvalue?

A number telling us **how much** an Eigenvector was stretched or compressed.

```
v = [1]        Av = [3]
    [2]              [6]

[3]   =  3 × [1]
[6]          [2]

The vector was scaled by exactly 3 → Eigenvalue = 3
```

---

## 5. Formal Definition

```
A v = λ v

A = the matrix (transformation)
v = Eigenvector
λ (lambda) = Eigenvalue
```

**Left side:** apply the transformation. **Right side:** just scale the original vector. If both sides give the **same result**, `v` is an Eigenvector of `A`, and `λ` is its Eigenvalue.

---

## 6. How Many Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors Does a Matrix Have?

> **One-liner:** An `n × n` (square) matrix has **up to `n` eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs**. So a `4×4` matrix can have up to 4 eigenvalues — exactly why the earlier example table lists `V1, V2, V3, V4`.

Only **square** matrices have eigenvalues/eigenvectors — this concept doesn't apply to rectangular matrices directly (though a related idea, **Singular Value Decomposition**, extends it to any matrix shape — see Section 16).

---

## 7. How Are Eigenvalues Actually Calculated? (Quick Method)

You won't need to do this by hand in practice (libraries handle it), but seeing it once removes the "magic" from the formula `Av = λv`.

Starting from `Av = λv`, rearranging gives:
```
(A - λI) v = 0
```
For a non-zero vector `v` to satisfy this, the matrix `(A - λI)` must be **non-invertible**, which means its **determinant must be zero**:
```
det(A - λI) = 0      ← this is called the "characteristic equation"
```

### Quick Worked Example
```
A = [2 0]
    [0 3]

A - λI = [2-λ   0  ]
         [0    3-λ ]

det(A - λI) = (2-λ)(3-λ) - 0 = 0
→ λ = 2  or  λ = 3
```
Each of these eigenvalues then gets plugged back into `(A - λI)v = 0` to solve for its corresponding eigenvector.

> For larger matrices, this hand-calculation becomes tedious fast — which is exactly why, in practice, you always use a library function instead (Section 8).

---

## 8. Computing Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors in Code

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[2, 0],
              [0, 3]])

eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(A)

print(eigenvalues)   # [2. 3.]
print(eigenvectors)  # corresponding eigenvectors, as columns
```

> This is the **standard, recommended approach** for any matrix beyond trivial 2×2 examples.

---

## 9. Real-Life Analogy — The Highway

Cars can travel in many directions, but the road itself defines the **dominant direction** — similar to an Eigenvector. Traffic volume along that road is similar to the Eigenvalue.

---

## 10. Positive, Negative, and Zero Eigenvalues

| Eigenvalue | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `λ = 5` (positive) | Stretch by 5x, direction stays the same |
| `λ = -3` (negative) | Stretch by 3x, but **flip direction** |
| `λ = 0` | Collapse to zero — information along that direction **disappears entirely** |

---

## 11. Quick Shortcuts: Sum and Product of Eigenvalues (Commonly Missing)

Two handy facts that connect eigenvalues to concepts from the Matrices guide:

```
Sum of all Eigenvalues      =  Trace of the matrix (sum of diagonal elements)
Product of all Eigenvalues  =  Determinant of the matrix
```

> **Why useful:** This gives you a free sanity check — if you compute eigenvalues by hand and their sum doesn't match the matrix's trace, you made an arithmetic mistake somewhere.

---

## 12. Why Should ML Engineers Care?

Because Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors help answer: **"Which directions contain the most information?"** — exactly what PCA does.

---

## 13. The Core PCA Problem

```
100 Features → training becomes slow, expensive, noisy

We want: 100 Features → 10 Features, while preserving most information.
```
This process is called **Dimensionality Reduction**.

---

## 14. Enter PCA

**PCA = Principal Component Analysis.** Goal: find the most important **directions** in the dataset. Those directions are **Eigenvectors**.

### Visual Example
```
Data points:
*
  *
     *
        *
           *
```
Data naturally follows one direction — PCA finds this **most important direction** using an Eigenvector.

---

## 15. Principal Components

In PCA, Eigenvectors become **Principal Components**:
```
Most important Eigenvector   → Principal Component 1
Second most important        → Principal Component 2
...and so on
```

---

## 16. Why Principal Components Are Always Perpendicular (Commonly Missing)

This connects directly to the **Orthogonality** concept from the Vectors guide:

> **Key fact:** The Covariance Matrix used in PCA is always a **Symmetric Matrix** (see the Matrices guide). A special mathematical property guarantees that **the eigenvectors of any symmetric matrix are always orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other.**

This is *why* Principal Component 1 and Principal Component 2 are always perpendicular in a PCA plot — it's not a coincidence, it's a guaranteed mathematical consequence of the covariance matrix being symmetric.

---

## 17. What Eigenvalues Tell PCA

```
Large Eigenvalue  →  Important Direction (lots of information/variance)
Small Eigenvalue  →  Less Important Direction (mostly noise)
```

### Example

| Eigenvector | Eigenvalue |
|---|---|
| V1 | 100 |
| V2 | 40 |
| V3 | 2 |
| V4 | 0.5 |

### Turning This Into a Decision: Explained Variance Ratio (Commonly Missing)

To decide *exactly* how many components to keep, convert eigenvalues into percentages:
```
Explained Variance Ratio (for each component) = its eigenvalue / sum of ALL eigenvalues

Total = 100 + 40 + 2 + 0.5 = 142.5

V1: 100 / 142.5 = 70.2%
V2: 40  / 142.5 = 28.1%
V3: 2   / 142.5 = 1.4%
V4: 0.5 / 142.5 = 0.35%
```
**V1 + V2 = 98.3%** of all the variance in the data — meaning we can safely keep just these two components and discard V3/V4, losing less than 2% of the original information.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca.fit(X)
print(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)   # e.g. [0.702, 0.281]
```

---

## 18. Why PCA Uses Eigenvectors

Because Eigenvectors reveal the **natural directions** inside the data. Instead of analyzing 100 original features, we look at just a few important directions.

---

## 19. PCA Workflow

```
Step 1: Start with Dataset X
Step 2: Standardize the Data
Step 3: Compute the Covariance Matrix C
Step 4: Find Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of C
Step 5: Sort by Eigenvalue (largest first)
Step 6: Keep the Top Eigenvectors
Step 7: Project the Data onto them → Reduced dimensions obtained
```

---

## 20. Why This Works

Even with 100 original features, most of the actual *information* often lies along just 2-3 directions. PCA discovers exactly those directions — and they are Eigenvectors.

---

## 21. Real-World Examples

| Use Case | How Eigenvectors/Eigenvalues Help |
|---|---|
| **Face Recognition** | Reduces 10,000 pixel-dimensions down to ~100, while preserving most identifying information — huge memory savings |
| **Recommendation Systems** | Discover hidden patterns in massive user-product matrices (e.g., "Action Movie Lovers", "Comedy Lovers") |
| **Image Compression** | Identify important structures in an image and discard less important (redundant) information |
| **Noise Removal** | Large eigenvalues = useful signal; small eigenvalues = noise — PCA often removes the noisy dimensions entirely |

---

## 22. Connection with Variance

PCA searches for directions with **Maximum Variance**, because more variance = more information. Eigenvectors point to these directions; Eigenvalues tell you exactly how much variance exists along each one.

---

## 23. Eigendecomposition & Connection to SVD (Brief, Commonly Missing)

Two related ideas you'll often see referenced alongside eigenvalues:

| Term | One-liner |
|---|---|
| **Eigendecomposition** | Breaking a (square) matrix down as `A = QΛQ⁻¹`, where `Q`'s columns are the eigenvectors and `Λ` is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues — essentially "unpacking" a matrix into its core directions and their strengths |
| **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)** | A generalization of eigendecomposition that works on **any** matrix shape (not just square ones) — its "singular values" play a very similar role to eigenvalues, which is why SVD shows up constantly alongside PCA in real implementations |

---

## 24. Interview Intuition

**Q: Why do we use Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors in PCA?**

**A:** Eigenvectors identify the most important directions in the data, while Eigenvalues measure how much information (variance) exists along those directions. PCA keeps directions with large Eigenvalues and removes directions with small Eigenvalues.

---

## 25. Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1 — "I need to manually calculate Eigenvalues"
Reality: libraries handle this (`np.linalg.eig()`). Knowing the characteristic-equation method (Section 7) helps intuition, but you'll essentially never do it by hand in real work.

### Misconception 2 — "Eigenvalues are only for exams"
Reality: they power PCA, Compression, Computer Vision, and Recommendation Systems in production ML systems.

### Misconception 3 — "I need advanced mathematics to use this"
Reality: for ML, `Direction = Eigenvector` and `Importance = Eigenvalue` is enough intuition to get started.

---

## 26. Common Interview Questions

**Q: What is an Eigenvector?**
A vector whose direction remains unchanged after a transformation.

**Q: What is an Eigenvalue?**
A value that tells how much an Eigenvector is stretched or compressed.

**Q: Why are Eigenvalues important?**
They measure the importance of each Eigenvector (how much variance/information it carries).

**Q: How are Eigenvalues used in PCA?**
PCA keeps Eigenvectors associated with large Eigenvalues and discards those with small Eigenvalues.

**Q: What do Eigenvectors represent in PCA?**
Principal directions of maximum variance in the dataset.

**Q: Why are the Principal Components in PCA always perpendicular to each other?**
Because the Covariance Matrix used in PCA is symmetric, and the eigenvectors of any symmetric matrix are guaranteed to be orthogonal.

**Q: What is the "explained variance ratio"?**
Each eigenvalue divided by the sum of all eigenvalues — it tells you what percentage of the total information/variance a given principal component captures, helping decide how many components to keep.

**Q: How many eigenvalues can an `n × n` matrix have?**
Up to `n`.

## 28. What You Must Master

Before moving deeper into PCA, make sure you understand:

- Matrix as a Transformation
- Eigenvector Intuition (direction stays the same) and Eigenvalue Intuition (amount of stretch)
- The meaning of `Av = λv`
- 🌟 Why Eigenvectors of a symmetric (covariance) matrix are always orthogonal
- The Variance concept and why PCA searches for directions of maximum variance
- Explained Variance Ratio — and how it guides how many components to keep
- The PCA Workflow end-to-end
- Why production code always uses a library (`np.linalg.eig`) instead of manual calculation

Remember the core intuition:
```
Eigenvector = Important Direction
Eigenvalue  = Importance of that Direction
```
This single idea explains roughly 80% of what a beginner ML engineer needs to know about Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.
