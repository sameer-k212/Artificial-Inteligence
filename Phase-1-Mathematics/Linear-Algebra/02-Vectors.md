# Vectors for Machine Learning 

Vectors are one of the most fundamental concepts in Linear Algebra and Machine Learning. Before understanding matrices, neural networks, embeddings, or transformers, you must understand vectors.

---

## 1. What is a Vector?

A **vector** is an ordered collection of numbers.

Examples: `[2, 4]`, `[1, 3, 5]`, `[170, 65, 21]`

Unlike a scalar (a single number), a vector contains **multiple values**, arranged in a specific order.

### Real-Life ML Example
Suppose we have a student's data:
```
Height = 170 cm
Weight = 65 kg
Age = 21 years
```
This becomes:
```
x = [170, 65, 21]
```
This is called a **feature vector**.

> **Feature Vector — one-liner:** A vector where each element represents one measurable property (feature) of a data point.

In Machine Learning, every data point is usually converted into a vector before a model can process it.

---

## 2. Why Vectors Matter in ML

Machines can't directly understand raw labels like `"Jai, Age = 21, Weight = 65"` — but they can understand `[170, 65, 21]`.

Almost everything in ML eventually becomes a vector:

| Data Type | Becomes |
|---|---|
| House Data | Vector |
| Customer Data | Vector |
| Images | Vector |
| Text | Vector |
| Audio | Vector |

---

## 3. Scalar vs Vector (Quick Recap)

| | Scalar | Vector |
|---|---|---|
| Definition | A single number | A collection of numbers |
| Example | `5` | `[1, 2, 3]` |
| ML Examples | Learning Rate, Accuracy, Loss | Feature data, Embeddings |

---

## 4. Vector Dimensions

The number of elements inside a vector is called its **dimension**.

| Vector | Dimension |
|---|---|
| `[3, 4]` | 2D |
| `[2, 4, 6]` | 3D |
| `[x1, x2, ..., x100]` | 100D |

### ML Example
House dataset features: `Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Parking, Age`

```
Vector = [1500, 3, 2, 1, 5]
Dimension = 5   (because there are 5 features)
```

---

## 5. Geometric Interpretation

A vector can represent **position, direction, or movement**.

```
[3, 4]  means:
Move 3 units on the x-axis
Move 4 units on the y-axis
```

The arrow drawn from the origin `(0,0)` to the point `(3,4)` *is* the vector.

---

## 6. Magnitude of a Vector

**Magnitude** = the length of a vector. Also called the **norm** or **length**.

For `[3, 4]`:
```
magnitude = √(3² + 4²) = √25 = 5
```

### General Formula (this is specifically the L2 / Euclidean norm)
```
For vector [x1, x2, ..., xn]:

||x|| = √(x1² + x2² + ... + xn²)
```

### L1 Norm vs L2 Norm (commonly missed distinction)

| Norm | Formula | One-liner |
|---|---|---|
| **L1 Norm (Manhattan)** | `\|x1\| + \|x2\| + ... + \|xn\|` | Sum of absolute values — measures distance like walking along city blocks |
| **L2 Norm (Euclidean)** | `√(x1² + x2² + ... + xn²)` | Straight-line ("as the crow flies") distance — what people usually mean by "magnitude" |

> **Why this matters:** L1 and L2 norms show up directly as **L1 Regularization (Lasso)** and **L2 Regularization (Ridge)** — two of the most common techniques used to prevent overfitting in ML models.

### Why Magnitude Matters in ML
Used in: **KNN, Clustering, Embeddings, Recommendation Systems** — anywhere "how large/important is this vector" needs to be measured.

---

## 7. Direction of a Vector

- **Magnitude** tells you: *how far?*
- **Direction** tells you: *which way?*

`[3, 4]` and `[6, 8]` have **different magnitudes** but the **same direction**.

### ML Intuition
```
Customer A spends = [10, 20]
Customer B spends = [20, 40]
```
Customer B spends more (bigger magnitude), but their **spending pattern/ratio is identical** — direction captures this similarity, even when scale differs.

---

## 8. Unit Vector and Normalization

A **unit vector** is a vector whose magnitude is exactly `1`.

Example: `[0.6, 0.8]` → magnitude = `√(0.6² + 0.8²) = √1 = 1` ✓

### Normalization — the process of creating a unit vector
```
v_hat = v / ||v||
```
> **Normalization (of a vector) — one-liner:** Dividing a vector by its own magnitude so its length becomes 1 while its direction stays exactly the same.

### Why Unit Vectors Matter
- Preserve direction
- Remove scale differences between vectors
- Used heavily in: **Similarity Search, Embeddings, NLP Models, Recommendation Systems**

---

## 9. Vector Addition

Add corresponding elements:
```
[1, 2] + [3, 4] = [4, 6]
```

### Interpretation
```
Day 1 Sales = [100, 200]
Day 2 Sales = [50, 75]
Total       = [150, 275]
```

### ML Usage
Used in: **Embedding Updates, Gradient Updates, Feature Engineering**

---

## 10. Vector Subtraction

Subtract corresponding elements:
```
[5, 7] - [2, 3] = [3, 4]
```

### ML Usage
Used in: **Error Calculation, Distance Calculation, Optimization**

---

## 11. Scalar Multiplication

Multiply every element of the vector by a scalar:
```
3 × [1, 2] = [3, 6]
```

### Why It Matters
Used in: **Learning Rate Updates, Gradient Descent, Feature Scaling**

```
0.01 × Gradient
```
This exact pattern appears in nearly every ML training loop.

---

## 12. Dot Product

One of the **most important** vector operations in ML.

```
[1, 2, 3] · [4, 5, 6] = 1×4 + 2×5 + 3×6 = 32
```

### Formula
```
a · b = Σ (ai × bi)   for i = 1 to n
```

> **Dot Product — one-liner:** Multiplies corresponding elements of two equal-length vectors and sums the results, producing a single **scalar**.

### Why Dot Product Matters
The dot product measures **similarity**:
- Large dot product → more similar
- Small/negative dot product → less similar

### Real ML Example — Netflix Recommendation
```
User Preferences = [5, 4, 5]
Movie Features   = [5, 4, 5]
Dot Product       = High  →  Strong Recommendation
```

---

## 13. Dot Product vs Element-wise (Hadamard) Product — Don't Confuse These

A very common beginner mix-up:

| Operation | Example | Result | Output Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dot Product** | `[1,2]·[3,4]` | `1×3 + 2×4 = 11` | A single **scalar** |
| **Element-wise (Hadamard) Product** | `[1,2] ⊙ [3,4]` | `[1×3, 2×4] = [3, 8]` | A **vector** (same shape as input) |

> **Hadamard Product — one-liner:** Multiplies two vectors (or matrices) of the same shape element-by-element, producing another vector/matrix — not a single number.

This distinction matters a lot in deep learning code, where using `*` (element-wise) instead of a true dot product (`@` or `np.dot`) is a very common bug.

---

## 14. Cross Product (Brief Note)

Unlike the dot product, the **cross product** only applies to **3D vectors**, and its result is **another vector** (perpendicular to both inputs), not a scalar.

> **Cross Product — one-liner:** An operation on two 3D vectors that produces a new vector perpendicular to both — rarely used in standard ML, but appears in robotics/3D graphics-adjacent ML work (e.g., physics simulations, computer vision).

It's mentioned here mainly so you don't confuse it with the dot product.

---

## 15. Cosine Similarity

One of the most common similarity metrics in ML.

### Formula
```
cos(θ) = (a · b) / (||a|| × ||b||)
```

> **Cosine Similarity — one-liner:** Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, telling you how similar their *direction* is — regardless of their magnitude.

### Interpretation

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `cos(θ) ≈ 1` | Very similar (pointing the same way) |
| `cos(θ) = 0` | Unrelated (perpendicular) |
| `cos(θ) ≈ -1` | Very different (pointing opposite ways) |

### Used In
**Search Engines, NLP, Recommendation Systems, Embeddings, LLMs**

---

## 16. Distance Between Vectors

### Euclidean Distance
```
A = [1, 2]
B = [4, 6]

distance = √((4-1)² + (6-2)²) = √25 = 5
```

### Manhattan Distance (pairs with the L1 norm from Section 6)
```
distance = |4-1| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7
```

> **Manhattan Distance — one-liner:** Sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements — like moving only along grid lines (city blocks), never diagonally.

### Why Distance Matters
Used in: **KNN, Clustering, Anomaly Detection**

- Smaller distance → more similar
- Larger distance → less similar

---

## 17. Orthogonal Vectors

**Orthogonal** means perpendicular. Condition: `a · b = 0`

Example: `[1, 0]` and `[0, 1]` → dot product = `0` → orthogonal.

### Why Orthogonality Matters
Used in: **PCA, SVD, Deep Learning, Embeddings**

Orthogonal vectors carry **independent information** — no overlap or redundancy between them.

---

## 18. Vector Projection (commonly missing concept)

**Projection** answers: *"How much of vector `a` points in the direction of vector `b`?"*

### Formula
```
proj_b(a) = ( (a · b) / ||b||² ) × b
```

> **Vector Projection — one-liner:** "Casts a shadow" of one vector onto another, showing how much of the first vector lies along the second vector's direction.

This concept underlies **PCA** (which projects high-dimensional data onto fewer, most-informative directions).

---

## 19. Feature Vectors

In ML, vectors most often represent **features** of a data point.

```
House: Area = 1500, Bedrooms = 3, Bathrooms = 2, Age = 5
Vector = [1500, 3, 2, 5]
```

---

## 20. Word Embeddings

Words can also become vectors.

```
"King"  → [0.1, 0.9, 0.4, ...]
"Queen" → [0.2, 0.8, 0.5, ...]
```

> **Word Embedding — one-liner:** A learned numeric vector representation of a word, where words with similar meanings end up close together in the vector space.

Modern NLP models represent words (and even entire sentences) as vectors.

---

## 21. Images as Vectors

A `28 × 28` image contains `784` pixels. It can be **flattened** into:
```
[x1, x2, ..., x784]
```
— a single, very long vector.

---

## 22. Neural Networks and Vectors

```
Input Layer:    x
Weight Vector:  w
Prediction:     x · w   (this is a dot product!)
```

Neural networks perform **millions of vector operations** every single second during training and inference.

## 23. Key ML Terms That Rely on Vectors (One-Liners)

| Term | One-liner |
|---|---|
| **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** | A technique that reduces the number of features in data by projecting it onto the directions (vectors) that capture the most variance |
| **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)** | A matrix factorization technique that breaks a matrix into simpler orthogonal components — used in PCA, recommendation systems, and compression |
| **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** | A simple ML algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class among its `k` closest neighbors (measured using vector distance) |
| **Clustering** | Grouping similar data points (vectors) together without using labels |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Identifying data points (vectors) that are unusually far/different from the rest of the dataset |
| **Embedding** | A learned vector representation of complex data (words, images, users) that captures meaningful relationships |
| **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** | The field of ML focused on understanding and generating human language |
| **LLM (Large Language Model)** | A massive neural network trained on huge amounts of text, internally representing words/sentences as high-dimensional vectors |
| **Transformer** | A neural network architecture (the basis of LLMs) that uses vector-based "attention" to figure out which words in a sentence matter most to each other |

## 24. Common Interview Questions

**Q: What is a vector?**
An ordered collection of numbers representing data, direction, or features.

**Q: What is magnitude?**
The length of a vector.

**Q: What is direction?**
The orientation of a vector in space.

**Q: What is a unit vector?**

**Q: What is a dot product?**
An operation that multiplies corresponding elements of two vectors and sums them, producing a scalar that measures similarity.

**Q: What's the difference between dot product and element-wise (Hadamard) product?**
Dot product returns a single scalar; Hadamard product returns a vector of the same shape, multiplying elements pairwise.

**Q: What is cosine similarity, and how is it different from the dot product?**
Cosine similarity is the dot product *normalized* by the magnitudes of both vectors — so it measures direction/angle only, ignoring scale.

**Q: Why are vectors important in ML?**
Because every piece of data is ultimately represented as a vector before a model can process it.
