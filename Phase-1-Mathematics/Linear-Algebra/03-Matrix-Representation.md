# Matrices for Machine Learning 

Matrices are one of the most important concepts in Linear Algebra and Machine Learning. If vectors are the building blocks of data, matrices are the **containers that hold entire datasets**. Almost every ML algorithm works with matrices.

| Data Type | Becomes |
|---|---|
| Datasets | Matrix |
| Images | Matrix |
| Neural Network Weights | Matrix |
| Embeddings | Matrix |
| Transformers (Attention) | Matrix |

Understanding matrices properly makes everything downstream in ML significantly easier.

## 1. What is a Matrix?

A **matrix** is a rectangular arrangement of numbers organized into rows and columns. Think of it as a table of numbers.

```
A = [1  2  3]
    [4  5  6]
```

---

## 2. Matrix Terminology

For the matrix above:

**Rows:**
```
[1 2 3]
[4 5 6]
```

**Columns:**
```
[1]    [2]    [3]
[4]    [5]    [6]
```

> **General Notation:** A matrix with `m` rows and `n` columns is described as an `m × n` matrix, and is often written generically as `A(m,n)`.

---

## 3. Why Matrices Matter in ML

Suppose we have a dataset:

| Height | Weight | Age |
|---|---|---|
| 170 | 65 | 21 |
| 180 | 75 | 25 |
| 160 | 55 | 20 |

ML sees this as:
```
X = [170  65  21]
    [180  75  25]
    [160  55  20]
```

This is called the **Feature Matrix**.

- **Rows** represent data points.
- **Columns** represent features.

---

## 4. Matrix Dimensions

Dimensions describe the size of a matrix, written as `Rows × Columns`.

| Matrix | Dimension |
|---|---|
| `[1 2]` | `1 × 2` |
| `[1; 2; 3]` (column) | `3 × 1` |
| `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]` | `2 × 3` |
| `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]` | `3 × 3` |

---

## 5. Rows and Columns in ML

Consider a housing dataset:

| Area | Bedrooms | Bathrooms |
|---|---|---|
| 1500 | 3 | 2 |
| 1800 | 4 | 3 |
| 1200 | 2 | 2 |

```
X = [1500  3  2]
    [1800  4  3]
    [1200  2  2]
```

### Rows = Samples
Each row represents **one house**. Example: `[1500, 3, 2]` is one single house's data.

### Columns = Features
Column 1 = Area, Column 2 = Bedrooms, Column 3 = Bathrooms — each column represents one **feature**.

---

## 6. Shape of a Matrix

"Shape" just means the dimensions, usually written as a tuple.

```
X = [170  65  21]
    [180  75  25]
    [160  55  20]

Shape = (3, 3)   →  3 Rows, 3 Columns
```

---

## 7. Why Shape Matters (and How Multiplication Actually Works)

Neural networks require specific matrix dimensions to be **compatible** before they can be multiplied together.

```
Input Matrix:   100 × 10
Weight Matrix:   10 × 5
✅ Multiplication WORKS — because the inner numbers (10 and 10) match.
Result shape:   100 × 5
```

```
Input Matrix:   100 × 10
Weight Matrix:    5 × 3
❌ Multiplication FAILS — inner numbers (10 and 5) don't match.
Dimension mismatch error.
```

> **Rule:** For `A × B` to work, the **number of columns in A** must equal the **number of rows in B**. The result takes the **rows of A** and the **columns of B**.

### A Quick Worked Example (so the rule isn't just abstract)

```
A (2×2) = [1  2]        B (2×2) = [5  6]
          [3  4]                  [7  8]

A × B = [ (1×5 + 2×7)   (1×6 + 2×8) ]   =  [19  22]
        [ (3×5 + 4×7)   (3×6 + 4×8) ]      [43  50]
```

> **One-liner:** Each element of the result is computed as a **dot product** of a row from `A` and a column from `B`. (Full matrix multiplication mechanics, transpose, and inverses are covered in detail in a separate "Matrix Operations" guide — this is just enough to understand *why* shapes must match.)

---

## 8. Basic Matrix Operations (Quick Overview)

### Addition / Subtraction
Add or subtract corresponding elements — **both matrices must have the exact same shape**.
```
[1 2]   [5 6]   [6  8]
[3 4] + [7 8] = [10 12]
```

### Scalar Multiplication
Multiply every element by a single number.
```
2 × [1 2] = [2 4]
    [3 4]   [6 8]
```

### 🚨 Matrix Multiplication vs Element-wise (Hadamard) Multiplication
A very common beginner mistake, especially in code:

| Operation | Symbol (NumPy) | What it does | Shape Requirement |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Matrix Multiplication** | `A @ B` or `np.dot(A, B)` | Row-by-column dot products (shown above) | Columns of A = Rows of B |
| **Element-wise (Hadamard) Multiplication** | `A * B` | Multiplies each position directly: `A[i,j] × B[i,j]` | Both matrices must have the **identical** shape |

```python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

A @ B   # Matrix multiplication → [[19, 22], [43, 50]]
A * B   # Element-wise multiplication → [[5, 12], [21, 32]]
```

> **Why this matters:** Using `*` when you meant `@` (or vice versa) is one of the most common silent bugs in deep learning code — both run without errors if shapes happen to match, but produce completely different (wrong) results.

## 9. Types of Matrices

### Row Matrix
Contains one row. `[1 2 3]` → Shape: `1 × 3`

### Column Matrix
Contains one column. `[1; 2; 3]` → Shape: `3 × 1`

### Square Matrix
Rows = Columns. `[[1,2],[3,4]]` → Shape: `2 × 2`

### Rectangular Matrix
Rows ≠ Columns. `[[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]` → Shape: `2 × 3`

### Zero Matrix
All elements are zero. `[[0,0],[0,0]]` — commonly used to **initialize** weights or biases before training.

### Identity Matrix
The matrix equivalent of the number `1`.
```
I = [1 0]
    [0 1]
```
**Property:** `A × I = A` (multiplying by it changes nothing). Used in matrix inversion, optimization, and other linear algebra operations.

### Diagonal Matrix (commonly missing)
All values **outside the main diagonal are zero**; the diagonal itself can hold any values.
```
D = [5 0 0]
    [0 3 0]
    [0 0 7]
```
> **One-liner:** A diagonal matrix scales each axis independently — multiplying a vector by it stretches each component by its own factor, with no "mixing" between dimensions. (Notice the Identity Matrix is just a special case of a diagonal matrix, where every diagonal value happens to be `1`.)

### Symmetric Matrix (commonly missing)
A matrix that is **mirror-identical** across its main diagonal — meaning it equals its own transpose (`A = Aᵗ`).
```
S = [1 2 3]
    [2 5 6]
    [3 6 9]
```
> **Why it matters:** Covariance matrices (used heavily in PCA) and similarity matrices are always symmetric — this property often allows for faster, more stable computation.

---

## 10. Transpose (Quick Introduction)

The **transpose** of a matrix flips it over its diagonal — rows become columns, and columns become rows.

```
      [1 2 3]              [1 4]
A =   [4 5 6]      Aᵗ =     [2 5]
                            [3 6]
```

> **One-liner:** If `A` has shape `m × n`, then `Aᵗ` (transpose) has shape `n × m`. This is used constantly in ML — for example, to make matrix shapes compatible for multiplication, or in the Normal Equation for Linear Regression.

```python
A.T   # NumPy syntax for transpose
```

---

## 11. Determinant & Inverse (Quick Introduction)

Two more concepts you'll see referenced constantly, worth a one-liner each before going deeper elsewhere:

| Term | One-liner |
|---|---|
| **Determinant** | A single **scalar** number computed from a square matrix, telling you whether it's invertible (`determinant = 0` means it is NOT invertible) |
| **Inverse (`A⁻¹`)** | The matrix equivalent of "dividing by `A`" — `A × A⁻¹ = I` (Identity Matrix). Only exists if the determinant is non-zero |

> **Why this matters in ML:** Solving Linear Regression analytically (the "Normal Equation") and several optimization techniques require computing a matrix inverse.

---

## 12. Accessing Elements

For:
```
A = [1 2 3]
    [4 5 6]
```

`A[1,2]` (using 1-indexed Row, Column notation) means **Row 1, Column 2**, which is the value `2`.

> **Note:** In code (like NumPy/Python), indexing is **0-indexed**, so the same element would actually be accessed as `A[0,1]`.

---

## 13. Matrix as a Dataset

| Study Hours | Sleep Hours | Marks |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | 8 | 70 |
| 6 | 7 | 80 |
| 8 | 6 | 90 |

```
X = [4 8 70]
    [6 7 80]
    [8 6 90]
```

**Rows** = Students. **Columns** = Features. This is exactly how ML models receive data.

---

## 14. Matrix Storage in NumPy

```python
import numpy as np

X = np.array([
    [170, 65, 21],
    [180, 75, 25],
    [160, 55, 20]
])

X.shape        # (3, 3)
X.T            # Transpose → shape becomes (3, 3) here, but would flip for non-square matrices
X.reshape(1,9) # Reshape into a different shape (must have the same total number of elements)
```

---

## 15. Images as Matrices

A `3 × 3` grayscale image's pixel values:
```
[255 120  90]
[ 80 200  50]
[ 60  40 255]
```
**Image = Matrix.**

### Color Images
Actually stored as a **3D structure**: `Height × Width × Channels`. Example: `224 × 224 × 3`, where the 3 channels are Red, Green, and Blue.

> **Note:** Technically, once you go beyond 2 dimensions (like a color image), this is no longer just a "matrix" — it's a **tensor** (see the Scalars guide for the full Scalar → Vector → Matrix → Tensor hierarchy).

---

## 16. Neural Networks and Matrices

```
Input Data:   X
Weights:      W
Bias:         b

Prediction:   X·W + b
```

Everything here is matrix-based — Deep Learning is, in large part, **repeated matrix multiplication** at massive scale.

---

## 17. Common Matrix Mistakes

### Mistake 1 — Confusing rows and columns
```
Rows    → Samples
Columns → Features
```

### Mistake 2 — Ignoring dimensions
Always check `X.shape` before running an operation.

### Mistake 3 — Not understanding shape compatibility
Before multiplying, always verify: **Columns of A = Rows of B**.

### Mistake 4 — Using `*` instead of `@` (or vice versa) in code
Element-wise multiplication (`*`) and true matrix multiplication (`@`/`np.dot`) can both run **without throwing an error** if shapes happen to align — but produce completely different results. Always double-check which one you actually need.

## 19. Common Interview Questions

**Q: What is a matrix?**
A rectangular arrangement of numbers organized into rows and columns.

**Q: What are matrix dimensions?**
The number of rows and columns, e.g. `3 × 4` means 3 rows and 4 columns.

**Q: What do rows represent in ML? What about columns?**
Rows represent samples/observations; columns represent features/attributes.

**Q: What's required for two matrices to be multiplied together?**
The number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix.

**Q: What is the transpose of a matrix?**
Flipping a matrix over its diagonal, turning rows into columns and vice versa — an `m × n` matrix becomes `n × m`.

**Q: What's the difference between matrix multiplication and element-wise multiplication?**
Matrix multiplication computes row-by-column dot products and requires the columns of A to equal the rows of B. Element-wise multiplication multiplies values at matching positions directly, requiring both matrices to be the exact same shape.

**Q: What is a symmetric matrix?**
A matrix that equals its own transpose (`A = Aᵗ`) — common in covariance and similarity matrices.

**Q: When does a matrix NOT have an inverse?**
When its determinant equals zero.
